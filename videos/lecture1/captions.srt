1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,300
This is the first in a series of videos

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,140
that are going to be working through parts of the

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,300
process modeling components of this workshop.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,620
This workshop was initially offered as

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,580
a 4-day workshop

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,080
where the first 2 days are very coding-intensive

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,620
where we're working through 
very scripted exercises.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,600
Those are available on our website.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,920
The second 2 days with this workshop 
involve more lecture materials.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,920
And those don't have an accompanying script.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,020
So for anyone who is interested 
in working through these materials

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,780
and understanding the material that 
we cover during these lectures,

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,040
we're recording these lectures after the 
fact and making them publicly available.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,760
So the overview of the entire

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,120
day's worth of material is

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,020
a lecture on the theory and 
motivation underlying process modeling

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,540
and then illustrating that using the example of

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,640
Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity.

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,640
There's then several exercises

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,100
that we worked through as a group,

21
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,880
getting some experience working with

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,640
and thinking about the neutral theory.

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,080
and seeing how that works

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,400
when we mess with the parameters,

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,260
and how to implement that in R.

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,280
I'll be recording lectures 
and making them available

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,680
on the theory and motivation of process modeling 
and the example of Hubbell's neutral theory

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,820
and then coming back as we do at 
the end of the day to talk about

29
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,140
the general approach of recovering

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,800
parameters from the results of model simulations

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,660
using neutral theory as an example.

32
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,960
So the first topic is coming into this 
general conceptual space of what we're

33
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,100
referring to as process modeling and 
getting a sense for exactly what we

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,700
mean by this and how it might 
apply in ecology and evolution.

35
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,760
So let's look at 3 specific questions.

36
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,600
What do we mean when we're talking about 
something called the process model.

37
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,420
And then what are the potential applications

38
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,220
for process modeling for specifically 
ecological and evolutionary dynamics?

39
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,460
And then what are the limitations 
of an approach like this?

40
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,740
We can get excited about the strengths and it's

41
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,960
also important to come into things 
with eyes open about the limitations.

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,600
So what do we mean by process modeling anyway?

43
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,460
And a question to ask yourself 
and a question that's helpful to

44
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,100
think about is what comes up for you when you 
think about the notion of the process model.

45
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,080
You may have done a whole bunch of 
simulation modeling on your own.

46
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,240
Or you may have no idea. And either one is great.

47
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,200
In this context, when we 
talk about a process model,

48
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,320
I like to say it's essentially just a game.

49
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,120
in which we are

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,160
exploring some phenomenon of 
interest as a game that plays out

51
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,800
according to a series of rules.

52
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,800
How that game plays out is going to depend on 
both the sort of set of rules that we identified

53
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,020
and maybe some tunable parameters 
that we modify in our rules.

54
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,200
and then there's often an element of stochasticity

55
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,700
or chance.

56
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,140
So these or may not be deterministic 
at either large or small scales.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,820
Hubbell's neutral theory is actually a really 
great example of a process model that has been

58
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,700
hugely influential in community ecology.

59
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,060
Even if you may or may not think of yourself as

60
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,020
somebody who has dealt a great 
deal with simulation or process

61
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,340
modeling in general,

62
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,960
if you have some familiarity with the 
neutral theory, that's a process model.

63
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,660
We're also going to be using neutral theory in the

64
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,180
rest of the workshop as an 
example of a process model

65
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,740
that's relatively

66
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,100
constrained and in its set of rules

67
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,060
and relatively intuitive to look at 
the results and see what's going on.

68
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,160
We'll then build up in the second day 
of materials which are available on

69
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,640
the website to interacting with 
more elaborate process models

70
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,060
that still have neutral theory as kind 
of an underlying conceptual framework,

71
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,920
but are building in much more functionality 
and many, many more processes.

72
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,300
So when we set up a process model, 
there are a few things to keep in mind.

73
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:27,600
One is that whatever set of 
processes or games that we set up

74
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,140
they could be really straightforward 
or they could be really complex.

75
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,760
And even what seems like a relatively 
simple set of rules can turn out to be

76
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,560
really complex in terms of different 
ways the outcomes can play out

77
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,020
or in terms of the

78
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,200
amount of computational power required 
to explore the behavior of the model.

79
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,760
Often, what we'll find in a 
process model as I've mentioned

80
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,940
is that the outcomes aren't 
strictly deterministic.

81
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,420
It may not be that we run a model 
with the same set of parameters

82
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,380
and the same set of rules and we get 
exactly the same outcome every time

83
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,660
just in the way that maybe you play 
game of tic-tac-toe against your cousin

84
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,800
and sometimes you are going to end up with one 
arrangement of things and another time you're

85
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,740
going to end up with another another 
arrangement of the X's and the O's.

86
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,300
And finally, these models are not necessarily,

87
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,760
solvable analytically in the way 
that other modeling approaches.

88
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,080
often are, especially in ecology and evolution.

89
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,560
When we think about how we 
interpret a Lotka-Volterra model

90
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,020
we're often solving for right moments 
when the system is stable or solving

91
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,900
for how this system will even out equilibrium.

92
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,660
In a process model, it may be 
difficult or impossible to find

93
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,680
a closed form or asymptotic solution 
for how the model is going to play out

94
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,640
and that's fine

95
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,140
because that's not what we focus on when we 
focus on the outcomes of a process model.

96
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,340
It's also worth saying that 
sometimes it is possible to

97
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,420
solve one of these models,

98
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,260
especially if we take a limit of infinitely large

99
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,700
periods of time or infinitely large systems

100
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,720
these often have asymptotic solutions or

101
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,120
consistent emergent outcomes

102
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,620
that kind of transcend the minutiae 
of what's going on at small, scales.

103
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,900
So here is just an opportunity to think 
about some of the potential applications

104
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,580
of a process modeling approach

105
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,020
in ecology and evolution.

106
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,140
And here's a whole bunch of them.

107
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,520
I'm gonna talk them through a little bit.

108
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,680
Being able to set up a system 
of rules that describe a process

109
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,760
that we're interested in and 
then observe how those rules

110
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,740
play out to produce outcomes that 
we may be interested in is a really

111
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,520
flexible and really powerful, 
tool to have in our toolbox.

112
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,640
It's especially good for when we want to 
explore a phenomenon that involves some of these

113
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,740
traditionally, potentially really 
intractable or really challenging

114
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,240
components.

115
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,160
In particular, we may be 
interested in a set of processes

116
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,600
that play out over really long 
temporal scales over really large

117
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,060
portions of space over 
really large spatial scales.

118
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,480
and those models are going to be exploring

119
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,140
something that we couldn't necessarily 
get at by running an experiment.

120
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:33,960
Maybe we're interested in how all of the species 
ever have evolved and we just don't have time to

121
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,680
run experimental evolution 
across all of Earth's history.

122
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,820
Or maybe we're curious about, really large scale 
biogeographic phenomena that can't be addressed

123
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,620
in the real world.

124
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,440
We can also use this when we're 
interested in processes that

125
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,680
fall into the general space of 
what we can call complex systems

126
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,500
which are characterized by many interacting 
components that often generate feedbacks and

127
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,460
have interactions and outcomes that come 
out at different levels of organization.

128
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,860
Or are context dependent, where 
how some sub process plays out

129
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,900
varies depending on the state of the system.

130
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,400
And this is basically all by biological systems 
if we're going to be realistic about things.

131
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,600
And of course, often when we're trying to generate 
a theoretical model to understand the system

132
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,360
we abstract away some of this complexity.

133
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,980
We abstract away some of this context 
dependence. And that's great, right. That's fine.

134
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,520
That's how we arrive at insights. And

135
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,180
sometimes we would like to be 
able to incorporate more layers

136
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,700
of this complexity into a modeling approach.

137
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:56,280
And process models have more flexibility to 
incorporate this complex or variable set of rules.

138
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,900
This doesn't mean that it's 
a silver bullet of course

139
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:06,300
there's a limit to how much 
complexity we can build in or how much

140
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,760
Insight we can gain from a model that can trade 
off with the level of complexity that it involves.

141
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,520
So let's think about some use cases for 
process modeling in ecology and evolution.

142
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,140
One of the first uses cases is to 
do some scenario exploration when

143
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,440
we have some understanding of how a process works

144
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,800
and we want to do some exploration of 
what the outcome of that process might be

145
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,060
if we were to change

146
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,400
some parameter or rate,

147
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,900
change something about the inputs of a 
process to see how the outcomes change.

148
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,160
Another really powerful 
application for process modeling

149
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,820
that is really well exemplified by

150
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,200
Hubbell's neutral theory

151
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,280
is as a sort of a null or neutral model.

152
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,780
How would we expect the system to look at random?

153
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,740
How would we expect a potentially complex

154
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,620
interacting set of processes 
to play out in the absence

155
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,160
of some mechanism or some 
force that we're interested in?

156
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,660
And then comparing that to what 
we're observing in real data or

157
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,120
observing in other simulated data

158
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,240
to get a sense for how these mechanisms that 
we are potentially interested in exploring

159
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,260
manifest in a system when we can't necessarily

160
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:31,260
guess a priori how we would differentiate 
between the effects of this mechanism and

161
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,540
what we'd expect to see if this 
mechanism weren't operating.

162
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,360
As we talked about earlier, 
another possible use case

163
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,720
is to explore huge swaths of time and 
space that vastly exceed what we're

164
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,960
able to explore empirically or experimentally.

165
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,500
Or if we want to explore parallel universes:

166
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,300
to think about how a system would look

167
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,860
in a thousand years under, for example, 
different scenarios of climate change.

168
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,920
We can run different simulation 
models and mess with the climate

169
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,600
change parameter and see how things turn out.

170
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,180
And the last example is the potential use of

171
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,980
a process model to start to rule 
out possible generative processes

172
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,580
that may or may not be consistent with 
what we observe in the real world.

173
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,560
So for example, if we have observed a 
pattern in the real world, like for example,

174
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,540
a hollow curve species abundance distribution,

175
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:39,420
And we have a few ideas about 
potential generative models,

176
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,600
generative processes that could 
have created this pattern..

177
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:48,540
We can formalize those in the 
form of process models that

178
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,420
play out those processes in excruciating detail

179
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,500
and then compare the outcomes that we 
get from these simulation models to the

180
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,420
patterns that we're actually 
observing in the real world.

181
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,260
And this one is not necessarily a

182
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,100
positive affirmation that we have 
guessed the correct process if

183
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,680
the outcome of a model matches 
what we observe in the world.

184
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,600
But, it can be really useful to help us 
rule out potential generative mechanisms

185
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,840
that really don't give us things that 
match what we're saying in the real world.

186
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,620
And these are of course just a few potential 
applications that I'm talking about here.

187
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:32,400
I would invite you to take a minute to think 
about, daydream about, potential applications

188
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,740
for this kind of approach in whatever 
your area of interest or expertise may be.

189
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,660
And the last thing before we dig 
into talking about a process model,

190
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,040
neutral theory,

191
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,880
is taking a moment to think 
about some of the limitations

192
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,080
or on the box warnings about using process models.

193
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,600
Number one is that in order 
to really understand and

194
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,120
appropriately interpret the results 
that we get from a simulation model,

195
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,600
we need to have

196
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,120
a fairly rigorous understanding
of the underlying rules that define that model.

197
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:29,880
It may be that the system of rules or 
processes that are built into a model

198
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:36,280
may or may not be a reasonable approximation  of what is happening in the system of interest.

199
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,080
For example, we're going to 
be working a lot with a model

200
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,280
that uses what's called a birth death 
process with a fixed community size.

201
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:52,520
In this case we have a ecological 
community of, say, a hundred individuals.

202
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,920
And these individuals will die and be reborn,

203
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,880
but the number of individuals will never change.

204
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,480
And that constraint of a 
fixed number of individuals

205
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,640
has some really important implications 
for how the model behaves,

206
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,640
especially when that number is really small.

207
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:14,400
And that may or may not be a 
reasonable assumption that we make

208
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:21,120
that we can then use to transfer our 
results to how we think about real systems.

209
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:29,400
Maybe, a small island that does have a 
really fixed amount of resource availability

210
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,800
can be reasonably modeled this way

211
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:40,040
But, if we are in a system where the amount of 
resource availability or primary productivity

212
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,800
is fluctuating a lot

213
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Maybe that fixed number of individuals 
assumption is going to introduce things

214
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,640
that really drive us away from the 
thing that we're trying to model.

215
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,480
Another one that is always changing,

216
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,240
and also always a constraint,

217
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,560
is the reality of limits on computational power.

218
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,600
We can be really smart about 
how we code up a process model,

219
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,520
but the fact is these are always going 
to be more computationally intensive

220
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,000
than something that we can 
solve with a single equation.

221
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,880
And depending on the level of complexity

222
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,320
or the number of processes

223
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,440
or the amount of stochasticity

224
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,280
that we build into a model,

225
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:29,040
the computational resource demand 
that that model requires can increase.

226
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,400
(sometimes terrifyingly quickly!)

227
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:38,640
This has historically been a constraint 
on the whole process modeling approach.

228
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,040
If you don't have a computer and you're 
having to run one of these by hand,

229
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,520
you're going to be able to do a lot fewer 
simulations than if you have a computer.

230
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,440
But even now that we have computers,

231
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,040
we do have to be mindful about

232
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,160
what it is that we are building into our model

233
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,640
and whether or not that's going to be a feasible

234
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,400
request of the available resources.

235
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,880
At a more philosophical level

236
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,680
we have to be mindful that pattern

237
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,320
or successfully reproducing a pattern

238
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,680
via a process model

239
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,240
does not necessarily mean that the
way that we produced that pattern

240
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,400
is an accurate representation

241
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,200
of the processes that actually 
generated that process out in the world.

242
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,120
For example, if I were to

243
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,960
observe that the 10 people 
sitting around me in a restaurant

244
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,120
the 10 people I'm happening 
to eat dinner with that night,

245
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,160
I could come up with a story,

246
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,240
a backstory for each of these individuals

247
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,920
that would tell me the processes

248
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,960
in their lives that led them to 
be at this dinner table tonight.

249
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:55,520
And all of the story lines

250
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,400
would end with that person coming to this 
restaurant and being at this table tonight.

251
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,880
But maybe I don't know anything  about these people

252
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,400
and maybe I've just made some stuff up

253
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,560
and it happens to get me to the right answer.

254
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,240
That doesn't mean that my

255
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,360
stories that I've told myself

256
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,160
about how they got there

257
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,960
are correct about the underlying

258
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,600
processes that led them there.

259
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,160
Long way of saying,

260
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,080
that just because we've managed

261
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,800
to successfully reproduce

262
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,040
something that we're observing in nature

263
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,560
doesn't mean that the mechanisms

264
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,160
that we use to get there

265
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,960
are the right mechanisms to

266
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,880
explain what's happened out there.

267
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,520
And there's a variety of ways to get around this

268
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,600
or to become more specific

269
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,680
about what kinds of epistemological questions

270
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,560
are we asking with a process model

271
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,560
and how are we interacting

272
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,640
with data and different sources of evidence

273
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,080
to leverage these models.

274
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,360
For now we'll just say we need

275
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,680
to recognize that pattern is 
not the same thing as process.

276
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,800
That these models can't always

277
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,000
be fully diagnostic about generative processes.

278
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And finally, is the concept of 
what's called model identifiability.

279
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,320
This can be an issue with complex or simple models,

280
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,040
but really comes out with really complex models.

281
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,000
Eventually it can occur that

282
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,200
multiple different sets of rules

283
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,360
or multiple different combinations of parameter settings

284
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,320
will get us to functionally indistinguishable results.

285
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:36,120
When we have many different 
models that generate results

286
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,320
that we can't tell apart

287
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,600
that really limits our ability 
to use the results to infer

288
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,880
what has happened at the generative stages to produce these results.

289
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,080
When we're interacting with a process model

290
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,840
we want to keep these  considerations in mind because they are

291
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,960
really important for us to be

292
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,440
able to interact with these models in

293
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,960
an appropriate way as practitioners.
