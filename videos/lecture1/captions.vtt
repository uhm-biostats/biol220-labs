00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.300
This is the first in a series of videos

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.140
that are going to be working through parts of the

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.300
process modeling components of this workshop.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.620
This workshop was initially offered as

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.580
a 4-day workshop

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.080
where the first 2 days are very coding-intensive

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.620
where we're working through&nbsp;
very scripted exercises.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.600
Those are available on our website.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.920
The second 2 days with this workshop&nbsp;
involve more lecture materials.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.920
And those don't have an accompanying script.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.020
So for anyone who is interested&nbsp;
in working through these materials

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.780
and understanding the material that&nbsp;
we cover during these lectures,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.040
we're recording these lectures after the&nbsp;
fact and making them publicly available.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.760
So the overview of the entire

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.120
day's worth of material is

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.020
a lecture on the theory and&nbsp;
motivation underlying process modeling

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.540
and then illustrating that using the example of

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.640
Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.640
There's then several exercises

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.100
that we worked through as a group,

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.880
getting some experience working with

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.640
and thinking about the neutral theory.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.080
and seeing how that works

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.400
when we mess with the parameters,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.260
and how to implement that in R.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.280
I'll be recording lectures&nbsp;
and making them available

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.680
on the theory and motivation of process modeling&nbsp;
and the example of Hubbell's neutral theory

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.820
and then coming back as we do at&nbsp;
the end of the day to talk about

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.140
the general approach of recovering

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.800
parameters from the results of model simulations

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.660
using neutral theory as an example.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.960
So the first topic is coming into this&nbsp;
general conceptual space of what we're

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.100
referring to as process modeling and&nbsp;
getting a sense for exactly what we

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.700
mean by this and how it might&nbsp;
apply in ecology and evolution.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.760
So let's look at 3 specific questions.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.600
What do we mean when we're talking about&nbsp;
something called the process model.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.420
And then what are the potential applications

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.220
for process modeling for specifically&nbsp;
ecological and evolutionary dynamics?

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.460
And then what are the limitations&nbsp;
of an approach like this?

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.740
We can get excited about the strengths and it's

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.960
also important to come into things&nbsp;
with eyes open about the limitations.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.600
So what do we mean by process modeling anyway?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.460
And a question to ask yourself&nbsp;
and a question that's helpful to

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.100
think about is what comes up for you when you&nbsp;
think about the notion of the process model.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.080
You may have done a whole bunch of&nbsp;
simulation modeling on your own.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.240
Or you may have no idea. And either one is great.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.200
In this context, when we&nbsp;
talk about a process model,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.320
I like to say it's essentially just a game.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.120
in which we are

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.160
exploring some phenomenon of&nbsp;
interest as a game that plays out

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.800
according to a series of rules.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.800
How that game plays out is going to depend on&nbsp;
both the sort of set of rules that we identified

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.020
and maybe some tunable parameters&nbsp;
that we modify in our rules.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.200
and then there's often an element of stochasticity

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.700
or chance.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.140
So these or may not be deterministic&nbsp;
at either large or small scales.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.820
Hubbell's neutral theory is actually a really&nbsp;
great example of a process model that has been

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.700
hugely influential in community ecology.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.060
Even if you may or may not think of yourself as

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.020
somebody who has dealt a great&nbsp;
deal with simulation or process

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.340
modeling in general,

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.960
if you have some familiarity with the&nbsp;
neutral theory, that's a process model.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.660
We're also going to be using neutral theory in the

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.180
rest of the workshop as an&nbsp;
example of a process model

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.740
that's relatively

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.100
constrained and in its set of rules

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.060
and relatively intuitive to look at&nbsp;
the results and see what's going on.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.160
We'll then build up in the second day&nbsp;
of materials which are available on

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.640
the website to interacting with&nbsp;
more elaborate process models

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.060
that still have neutral theory as kind&nbsp;
of an underlying conceptual framework,

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.920
but are building in much more functionality&nbsp;
and many, many more processes.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.300
So when we set up a process model,&nbsp;
there are a few things to keep in mind.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.600
One is that whatever set of&nbsp;
processes or games that we set up

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.140
they could be really straightforward&nbsp;
or they could be really complex.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.760
And even what seems like a relatively&nbsp;
simple set of rules can turn out to be

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.560
really complex in terms of different&nbsp;
ways the outcomes can play out

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.020
or in terms of the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.200
amount of computational power required&nbsp;
to explore the behavior of the model.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.760
Often, what we'll find in a&nbsp;
process model as I've mentioned

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.940
is that the outcomes aren't&nbsp;
strictly deterministic.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.420
It may not be that we run a model&nbsp;
with the same set of parameters

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.380
and the same set of rules and we get&nbsp;
exactly the same outcome every time

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.660
just in the way that maybe you play&nbsp;
game of tic-tac-toe against your cousin

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.800
and sometimes you are going to end up with one&nbsp;
arrangement of things and another time you're

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.740
going to end up with another another&nbsp;
arrangement of the X's and the O's.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.300
And finally, these models are not necessarily,

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.760
solvable analytically in the way&nbsp;
that other modeling approaches.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.080
often are, especially in ecology and evolution.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.560
When we think about how we&nbsp;
interpret a Lotka-Volterra model

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.020
we're often solving for right moments&nbsp;
when the system is stable or solving

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.900
for how this system will even out equilibrium.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.660
In a process model, it may be&nbsp;
difficult or impossible to find

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.680
a closed form or asymptotic solution&nbsp;
for how the model is going to play out

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.640
and that's fine

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.140
because that's not what we focus on when we&nbsp;
focus on the outcomes of a process model.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.340
It's also worth saying that&nbsp;
sometimes it is possible to

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.420
solve one of these models,

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.260
especially if we take a limit of infinitely large

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.700
periods of time or infinitely large systems

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.720
these often have asymptotic solutions or

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.120
consistent emergent outcomes

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.620
that kind of transcend the minutiae&nbsp;
of what's going on at small, scales.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.900
So here is just an opportunity to think&nbsp;
about some of the potential applications

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.580
of a process modeling approach

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.020
in ecology and evolution.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.140
And here's a whole bunch of them.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.520
I'm gonna talk them through a little bit.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.680
Being able to set up a system&nbsp;
of rules that describe a process

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.760
that we're interested in and&nbsp;
then observe how those rules

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.740
play out to produce outcomes that&nbsp;
we may be interested in is a really

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.520
flexible and really powerful,&nbsp;
tool to have in our toolbox.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.640
It's especially good for when we want to&nbsp;
explore a phenomenon that involves some of these

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.740
traditionally, potentially really&nbsp;
intractable or really challenging

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.240
components.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.160
In particular, we may be&nbsp;
interested in a set of processes

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.600
that play out over really long&nbsp;
temporal scales over really large

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.060
portions of space over&nbsp;
really large spatial scales.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.480
and those models are going to be exploring

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.140
something that we couldn't necessarily&nbsp;
get at by running an experiment.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:33.960
Maybe we're interested in how all of the species&nbsp;
ever have evolved and we just don't have time to

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.680
run experimental evolution&nbsp;
across all of Earth's history.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:44.820
Or maybe we're curious about, really large scale&nbsp;
biogeographic phenomena that can't be addressed

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.620
in the real world.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.440
We can also use this when we're&nbsp;
interested in processes that

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.680
fall into the general space of&nbsp;
what we can call complex systems

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.500
which are characterized by many interacting&nbsp;
components that often generate feedbacks and

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.460
have interactions and outcomes that come&nbsp;
out at different levels of organization.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:13.860
Or are context dependent, where&nbsp;
how some sub process plays out

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.900
varies depending on the state of the system.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.400
And this is basically all by biological systems&nbsp;
if we're going to be realistic about things.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:27.600
And of course, often when we're trying to generate&nbsp;
a theoretical model to understand the system

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.360
we abstract away some of this complexity.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.980
We abstract away some of this context&nbsp;
dependence. And that's great, right. That's fine.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.520
That's how we arrive at insights. And

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.180
sometimes we would like to be&nbsp;
able to incorporate more layers

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.700
of this complexity into a modeling approach.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:56.280
And process models have more flexibility to&nbsp;
incorporate this complex or variable set of rules.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.900
This doesn't mean that it's&nbsp;
a silver bullet of course

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:06.300
there's a limit to how much&nbsp;
complexity we can build in or how much

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:11.760
Insight we can gain from a model that can trade&nbsp;
off with the level of complexity that it involves.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.520
So let's think about some use cases for&nbsp;
process modeling in ecology and evolution.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:25.140
One of the first uses cases is to&nbsp;
do some scenario exploration when

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.440
we have some understanding of how a process works

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.800
and we want to do some exploration of&nbsp;
what the outcome of that process might be

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.060
if we were to change

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.400
some parameter or rate,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.900
change something about the inputs of a&nbsp;
process to see how the outcomes change.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.160
Another really powerful&nbsp;
application for process modeling

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.820
that is really well exemplified by

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.200
Hubbell's neutral theory

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.280
is as a sort of a null or neutral model.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.780
How would we expect the system to look at random?

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:01.740
How would we expect a potentially complex

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.620
interacting set of processes&nbsp;
to play out in the absence

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.160
of some mechanism or some&nbsp;
force that we're interested in?

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.660
And then comparing that to what&nbsp;
we're observing in real data or

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.120
observing in other simulated data

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:21.240
to get a sense for how these mechanisms that&nbsp;
we are potentially interested in exploring

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.260
manifest in a system when we can't necessarily

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:31.260
guess a priori how we would differentiate&nbsp;
between the effects of this mechanism and

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.540
what we'd expect to see if this&nbsp;
mechanism weren't operating.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.360
As we talked about earlier,&nbsp;
another possible use case

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:48.720
is to explore huge swaths of time and&nbsp;
space that vastly exceed what we're

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:54.960
able to explore empirically or experimentally.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.500
Or if we want to explore parallel universes:

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.300
to think about how a system would look

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.860
in a thousand years under, for example,&nbsp;
different scenarios of climate change.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.920
We can run different simulation&nbsp;
models and mess with the climate

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.600
change parameter and see how things turn out.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:18.180
And the last example is the potential use of

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.980
a process model to start to rule&nbsp;
out possible generative processes

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.580
that may or may not be consistent with&nbsp;
what we observe in the real world.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:31.560
So for example, if we have observed a&nbsp;
pattern in the real world, like for example,

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.540
a hollow curve species abundance distribution,

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:39.420
And we have a few ideas about&nbsp;
potential generative models,

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.600
generative processes that could&nbsp;
have created this pattern..

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:48.540
We can formalize those in the&nbsp;
form of process models that

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.420
play out those processes in excruciating detail

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.500
and then compare the outcomes that we&nbsp;
get from these simulation models to the

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.420
patterns that we're actually&nbsp;
observing in the real world.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:01.260
And this one is not necessarily a

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:08.100
positive affirmation that we have&nbsp;
guessed the correct process if

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.680
the outcome of a model matches&nbsp;
what we observe in the world.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.600
But, it can be really useful to help us&nbsp;
rule out potential generative mechanisms

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.840
that really don't give us things that&nbsp;
match what we're saying in the real world.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:25.620
And these are of course just a few potential&nbsp;
applications that I'm talking about here.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:32.400
I would invite you to take a minute to think&nbsp;
about, daydream about, potential applications

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.740
for this kind of approach in whatever&nbsp;
your area of interest or expertise may be.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.660
And the last thing before we dig&nbsp;
into talking about a process model,

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.040
neutral theory,

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.880
is taking a moment to think&nbsp;
about some of the limitations

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.080
or on the box warnings about using process models.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.600
Number one is that in order&nbsp;
to really understand and

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:15.120
appropriately interpret the results&nbsp;
that we get from a simulation model,

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.600
we need to have

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:22.120
a fairly rigorous understanding
of the underlying rules that define that model.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:29.880
It may be that the system of rules or&nbsp;
processes that are built into a model

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:36.280
may or may not be a reasonable approximation&nbsp; of what is happening in the system of interest.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.080
For example, we're going to&nbsp;
be working a lot with a model

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:46.280
that uses what's called a birth death&nbsp;
process with a fixed community size.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:52.520
In this case we have a ecological&nbsp;
community of, say, a hundred individuals.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.920
And these individuals will die and be reborn,

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.880
but the number of individuals will never change.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.480
And that constraint of a&nbsp;
fixed number of individuals

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.640
has some really important implications&nbsp;
for how the model behaves,

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.640
especially when that number is really small.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:14.400
And that may or may not be a&nbsp;
reasonable assumption that we make

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:21.120
that we can then use to transfer our&nbsp;
results to how we think about real systems.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:29.400
Maybe, a small island that does have a&nbsp;
really fixed amount of resource availability

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.800
can be reasonably modeled this way

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:40.040
But, if we are in a system where the amount of&nbsp;
resource availability or primary productivity

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:40.800
is fluctuating a lot

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:46.800
Maybe that fixed number of individuals&nbsp;
assumption is going to introduce things

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.640
that really drive us away from the&nbsp;
thing that we're trying to model.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:56.480
Another one that is always changing,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.240
and also always a constraint,

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.560
is the reality of limits on computational power.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.600
We can be really smart about&nbsp;
how we code up a process model,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.520
but the fact is these are always going&nbsp;
to be more computationally intensive

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.000
than something that we can&nbsp;
solve with a single equation.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.880
And depending on the level of complexity

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.320
or the number of processes

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.440
or the amount of stochasticity

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.280
that we build into a model,

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:29.040
the computational resource demand&nbsp;
that that model requires can increase.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.400
(sometimes terrifyingly quickly!)

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:38.640
This has historically been a constraint&nbsp;
on the whole process modeling approach.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.040
If you don't have a computer and you're&nbsp;
having to run one of these by hand,

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.520
you're going to be able to do a lot fewer&nbsp;
simulations than if you have a computer.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.440
But even now that we have computers,

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.040
we do have to be mindful about

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:54.160
what it is that we are building into our model

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.640
and whether or not that's going to be a feasible

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.400
request of the available resources.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:06.880
At a more philosophical level

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.680
we have to be mindful that pattern

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.320
or successfully reproducing a pattern

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.680
via a process model

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.240
does not necessarily mean that the
way that we produced that pattern

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.400
is an accurate representation

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:25.200
of the processes that actually&nbsp;
generated that process out in the world.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.120
For example, if I were to

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.960
observe that the 10 people&nbsp;
sitting around me in a restaurant

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.120
the 10 people I'm happening&nbsp;
to eat dinner with that night,

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.160
I could come up with a story,

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.240
a backstory for each of these individuals

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.920
that would tell me the processes

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.960
in their lives that led them to&nbsp;
be at this dinner table tonight.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:55.520
And all of the story lines

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.400
would end with that person coming to this&nbsp;
restaurant and being at this table tonight.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.880
But maybe I don't know anything&nbsp;&nbsp;about these people

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.400
and maybe I've just made some stuff up

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.560
and it happens to get me to the right answer.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.240
That doesn't mean that my

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.360
stories that I've told myself

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.160
about how they got there

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.960
are correct about the underlying

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.600
processes that led them there.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.160
Long way of saying,

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.080
that just because we've managed

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.800
to successfully reproduce

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.040
something that we're observing in nature

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.560
doesn't mean that the mechanisms

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.160
that we use to get there

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.960
are the right mechanisms to

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.880
explain what's happened out there.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.520
And there's a variety of ways to get around this

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.600
or to become more specific

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.680
about what kinds of epistemological questions

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.560
are we asking with a process model

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.560
and how are we interacting

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.640
with data and different sources of evidence

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.080
to leverage these models.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.360
For now we'll just say we need

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.680
to recognize that pattern is&nbsp;
not the same thing as process.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.800
That these models can't always

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.000
be fully diagnostic about generative processes.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
And finally, is the concept of&nbsp;
what's called model identifiability.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.320
This can be an issue with complex or simple models,

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.040
but really comes out with really complex models.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.000
Eventually it can occur that

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.200
multiple different sets of rules

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.360
or multiple different combinations&nbsp;of parameter settings

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.320
will get us to functionally indistinguishable results.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:36.120
When we have many different&nbsp;
models that generate results

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.320
that we can't tell apart

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.600
that really limits our ability&nbsp;
to use the results to infer

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:46.880
what has happened at the generative stages to produce these results.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.080
When we're interacting with a process model

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.840
we want to keep these&nbsp;&nbsp;considerations in mind because they are

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.960
really important for us to be

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.440
able to interact with these models in

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:04.960
an appropriate way as practitioners.
