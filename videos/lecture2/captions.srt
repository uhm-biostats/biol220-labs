1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Okay, so now we're going to discuss process modeling within the framework of Hubbell's neutral theory.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:15,160
And if you're not familiar with Hubbell's neutral theory, it's fully called the Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:27,440
And it's a process model that describes how the diversity of ecological systems can change over time according to a very simple set of rules.

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:34,000
So we're going to discuss UNTB (which is how we'll refer to neutral theory) as a process model. 

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,400
Then we're going to get into the specific rules of neutral theory and the outcomes that we pay attention to.

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,120
And this will set us up to play the game interactively. 

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,160
We can do this with a set of die, or coded up as a set of functions in R.

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,200
Those pre-written functions are available on the course website.

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:11,000
So the Unified Neutral Theory has a fundamentally process modeling approach. In it, we're looking at a set of entities, which are ecological communities,

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:22,320
That are made up of a fixed number of individuals. So like the trees in the forest. And as the model plays out, individuals die, give birth,

11
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:31,520
immigrate (or arrive in the system from outside the system) and speciate into new species according to a set of rules and parameters.

12
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:41,040
And the outcomes of neutral theory are what I kind of call semi-deterministic in that the specific outcome of any given single run of this model

13
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:51,200
can't be predicted with detail - but that it exhibits dependable, consistent behaviors. Given enough runs with the same set of parameters,

14
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,200
we can be confident that we're going to end up with a general set of patterns that are consistent with what we have seen before.

15
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,880
So let's talk about the rules and then the outcomes of neutral theory.

16
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:15,080
The structure of a neutral model, or if a process model in general, is that we have a  playing field, or the board of the board game, 

17
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,120
we have the set of rules or processes by which the model proceeds 

18
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,000
and then we have a set of outcomes that are what we pay attention to and interpret as the model results.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,160
In neutral theory the playing field has 3 parts. 

20
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,280
Mostly we focus on this piece in the middle, the local community.

21
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,040
I like to use the example of a patch of garden plot in your backyard. 

22
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:47,040
Your garden plot in your backyard has some number of spots where things can grow.

23
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,000
And so the local community has a consistent size over time. 

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,560
And it's made up of different species of things that are growing in your garden.

25
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,600
We also have the meta community which I like to describe as your whole backyard 

26
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,760
or maybe your whole neighborhood 

27
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,400
and all of the plants that are growing in your backyard or your neighborhood.

28
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,920
The meta community acts as a source of new species that may land in your local garden plot

29
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,720
 or land in the local community and might start growing there.

30
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:24,439
And lastly we have - this is largely a bookkeeping piece but we do to keep track of it -

31
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:28,960
All of the species that we have ever had occur in our model.

32
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:37,040
And this may be different from all of the species that are still present in the system by the end of the model 

33
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,480
because in neutral theory species can go extinct, 

34
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,320
And so we have to keep track of everything we've ever seen 

35
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,360
because we may not still be seeing it by the end of the model.

36
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,720
Okay, so the process. 

37
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
What happens in a neutral model? 

38
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:58,680
So the defining feature of each time step in a neutral model is

39
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,720
 an individual from the local community has to die.

40
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:07,719
They are then replaced either through what's called a local birth -  

41
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:14,400
which is to say one of the other individuals in the local community has an offspring -

42
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,680
or via immigration, 

43
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,200
which would be when an individual from the wider meta community has, 

44
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:27,480
you can think of it as a seed or a juvenile that arrives in the local community and takes up living there.

45
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:34,640
Sometimes in this birth process, a speciation event can occur. 

46
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:43,280
The individual that establishes in the local community is of a never before seen species that is different from the parent species.

47
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:52,600
In the real world you can think of this as a mutation event where the offspring is now a new species separate from the parent.

48
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:55,720
And then this just repeats. 

49
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,280
And it can repeat for a set number of time steps.

50
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:07,440
 Often with neutral theory we'll repeat it until the model has reached some state that we can define as an equilibrium.

51
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,080
And it can be tricky to define an equilibrium in a process model, 

52
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,160
but for our purposes here, we'll say we can run it until it stops sort of changing a whole bunch.

53
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:24,800
And so neutral theory has a series of parameters that can be used to modify the outcomes of the model. 

54
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,520
These are the number of individuals in the meta community or the size of the meta community 

55
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,440
and the number of species in the meta community.

56
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,720
You can imagine that if there's only one species in the whole meta community, 

57
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,200
it's gonna be hard to get diversity in the local community drawing from that meta community.

58
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:50,960
At the local scale, we have also the number of individuals that are present in the local community.

59
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,880
For this little toy visual, that's there's 5 individuals in the local community. 

60
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,080
This parameter can also be really important.

61
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,880
You can get sometimes more idiosyncratic behaviors with very small local communities.

62
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,880
And it can become much harder computationally model as you have a really huge local community.

63
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:23,200
Then there are 2 more parameters that we can  tune like dials in a radio and explore how changing those parameters affects the models behavior.

64
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,040
And those are, the probability of an integration event occurring. 

65
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,040
So M. 

66
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:38,160
This is the probability that when a new individual is born, that individual's parent is coming from the meta community.

67
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,320
And if the individual's parent is not coming from the meta community, it's what we call a local birth.

68
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,200
So the individual's parent is coming from the local community. 

69
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,240
And lastly we have the parameter Nu.

70
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,760
Which is the probability that when that birth event occurs, 

71
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,280
whether the parent is from the meta community or from the local community,

72
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,560
the probability that that birth event is also a speciation event 

73
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,280
where the offspring is of a different species than its parent species

74
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:14,080
and it's a new species that we have never before encountered because it has never existed before.

75
00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:21,440
So let's work through the process in a little bit more exacting detail. 

76
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:28,800
Every time step, the first thing that happens is an individual is chosen at random to die.

77
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,360
The probability of any particular individual being the individual who has to die 

78
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,480
is going to be 1 / however many individuals there are

79
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,560
because every individual has an equal probability of dying.

80
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,040
That's part of what makes this a neutral model.

81
00:07:47,697 --> 00:07:55,080
By losing the orange individual here, we have created a gap in the local community 

82
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,320
and we need to fill that slot by having a birth event 

83
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
and filling that slot in with a new individual.

84
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,560
We need to have either a local birth event or an immigration event to start to fill in this slot.

85
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,680
So again, we'll roll the die. 

86
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,400
With probability 1-M, 

87
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,040
that birth event will be a local birth where the parent is chosen at random from the local community.

88
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:27,280
And if it's a local birth event, every individual in the local community 

89
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,297
has an equal probability of being the lucky parent. 

90
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:36,840
Again, this is neutral. No individual has a leg up and any other individual

91
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,000
around winning the birth lottery.

92
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,360
And the other way this can happen is if it's an immigration event 

93
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,920
so with probability M

94
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,480
a parent individual is chosen, again at random, 

95
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,680
from the meta community.

96
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,400
Again, no individual in the meta community has any advantage over any other individual in winning that lottery.

97
00:09:00,513 --> 00:09:04,720
Finally, before we can fill in that slot with our new individual, 

98
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,280
we do have to check if there's a speciation event happening at this time step.

99
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:16,720
With probability Nu, the birth will not simply be a new individual of the exact same species.

100
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,640
It will be a new individual of a novel species. 

101
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:26,920
If that happens, we need to update the species of the offspring to a brand new species

102
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,800
 and we have to make a note in our all-time species list

103
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:36,880
that we have added a brand new species to the all time list.

104
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:41,080
And if there's no speciation, we don't have to bother with any of that.

105
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:45,440
Once we've worked through these, like, decision trees, 

106
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,800
we can replace the individual who died with this new baby individual in the local community.

107
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:56,840
And then we're gonna do that indefinitely 

108
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,920
or until we've iterated over all the time steps that we're going to iterate over.

109
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:07,400
And so, say we've run this a whole bunch of times, then what do we do? 

110
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,360
Well, we're going to want to be looking at the outcomes of this model and 

111
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,680
with neutral theory we're interested in - or, for now, let's say, since there's many applications of neutral theory - 

112
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:27,600
but we're going to look at  the diversity and structure of that local community after we've run this model for a while.

113
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,080
So we can take the local community. 

114
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,520
And a common way of looking at abundance 

115
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,560
which you'll be very familiar with if you've worked through the previous 2 days of this workshop 

116
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,840
is to plot what's called a species abundance distribution, 

117
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:46,520
which is a means of visualizing how diversity is distributed within a system.

118
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:54,000
So for a quick primer, if you've skipped the past couple of days or just want a primer on species abundance distributions...

119
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,680
Here we've plotted on the x-axis the rank of species in the system 

120
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,960
if we rank them from the most to least abundant.

121
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,760
And on the y-axis we plotted how abundant each species is. 

122
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,040
This plot is telling us that the very most abundant species in the system has 3 individuals.

123
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,720
That's the green species. 

124
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,600
And the second most abundant species has one individual. And so does the third.

125
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,760
Those are the blue and the purple species. 

126
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:28,440
When we have a more realistically sized community with more species and more individuals

127
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,200
the shape of this distribution can tell us a lot about the structure of a system

128
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,440
whether we've got a whole bunch of species and they're all relatively equally abundant 

129
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,080
or whether we have maybe still a whole bunch of species but really all of the individuals

130
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,640
are accounted for by one really, really abundant species. 

131
00:11:47,597 --> 00:11:52,400
And so the shape of the species abundance distribution tells us a lot about community structure.

132
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:59,760
We can also quantify this evenness and diversity using what's called Hill numbers. 

133
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,160
For more information on Hill numbers, I encourage you to look at the materials from the previous two days of the workshop

134
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:13,640
because we work through applications of Hill numbers to all sorts of different biodiversity data, including abundance data like this.

135
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,920
For now we can say that if we calculate the Hill number 

136
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:25,040
it's a diversity index that will capture different aspects of this species abundance distribution 

137
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,280
based on this parameter q.

138
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:35,200
A hill number that's calculated using the parameter q of 0 is going to give us species richness.

139
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,960
And if we use q values, increasing q values, so q = 1 or q = 2 

140
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,600
we're going to be shifting the amount of weight that we put on

141
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,640
the shape of the species abundance distribution. 

142
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:57,480
And we're going to be taking into account more and more of the presence and representation of rare species in the system.

143
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:09,240
At this stage in the workshop, we worked through the neutral model a few times using an

144
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,960
interactive hands-on approach of a whiteboard and running the die.

145
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,440
If you would like to play that game a few times on your own, 

146
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,280
we've got this slide that you can refer to.

147
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:32,460
It can be informative to work through this manually by choosing parameters for J, M, and Nu 

148
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,640
and then playing through the cycle a few times.

149
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:42,600
There are also materials available on our website for running code

150
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,800
 to play neutral games on your own computer.

151
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,920
And we'll link to those materials along with these video lectures 

152
00:13:51,920 --> 00:14:00,280
so that you can gain a little bit of intuition for how the neutral model behaves.
