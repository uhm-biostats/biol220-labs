    "text": "1.1 Notes for asychronous use\nThese are the materials for the second 2 days of the “Multidimensional Biodiversity Data” workshop first offered in Albequerque, NM in June 2023 by the RoLE Model team. For the first two days’ materials, see the course website here.\nTo work through these materials asynchronously, you will need some software packages installed on your computer. We have provided a Docker image with the necessary packages already set up. To get going with this, see the setup instructions.\nThe first days’ materials (from “Theory/conceptual motivation for process models” through to “Intro to machine learning inference with neutral simulations”) are also available as video lectures on YouTube:\n\nTheory and motivation of process modeling\nThe Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity as a process model\nInferring the parameters of neutral theory from model outcomes"
