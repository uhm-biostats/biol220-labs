It is a free program, mainly written by volunteer contributors from around the world.\nRStudio is a separate program, also free, that allows you to easily organize separate tabs for R code files, graphic, help docs, and more.\nFor this course, you won’t need R and RStudio installed on your own device because we will work in Posit Cloud. However, if you wish to install them on your device, go to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ for instructions about getting set up."

Join the Workspace for each lab by clicking on the appropriate link in Google Classroom (e.g. “Lab 01-005 Posit Cloud Link” for the first week’s materials for section 005)\nImportant: Login with your userid@hawaii.edu account, not a personal gmail account. If you accidentally use your personal account, let me know. I will delete it while you register with the university account.\n\nNote: Wherever images say “lab02”, replace that with the actual lab number you will be completing (e.g. “lab01” or “lab11”).\n\n\nOnce you’re logged in, the lab01 Workspace will looking something like this (note: where it says “-monday” in the picture should be your section number):\n\n\nEach item listed under “All Projects” is a “Project” within the lab01-00# Workspace. Each week I will create a Project template that you will copy and work from (you cannot edit the original).\n\nTo create your own, click “START” to the left of “lab01”.\n\n\n\nOnce the Project is copied and deployed, rename the Project from “lab01” to include your name like this:\n\n“lab01-muir-chris”"
