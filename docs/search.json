It is a free program, mainly written by voluntary contributions from statisticians around the world. R is available on most operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.\nR can make graphics and do statistical calculations. It is also a full-fledged computing language. In this manual, we will only scratch the surface of what R can do.\n\n\n1.2.2 What is RStudio?\nRStudio is a separate program, also free, that provides a more elegant front end for R. RStudio allows you to easily organize separate windows for R commands, graphic, help, etc. in one place.\nFor this course, you won’t need R and RStudio installed on your own device because we will work in RStudio Cloud.

    "section": "1.3 Learning the Tools",
    "text": "1.3 Learning the Tools\nWhen you start RStudio Cloud, it will automatically start R as well. You run R inside RStudio Cloud.\nAfter you have started RStudio Cloud, you should see a new window with a menu bar at the top and three main sections. One of the sections is called the “Console” – this is where you type commands to give instructions to R and typically where you see R’s answers to you.\nAnother important corner of this window can show a variety of information. Most importantly to us, this is where graphics will appear, under the tab marked “Plots”.\n\n1.3.1 The command line\nWhen you start RStudio Cloud, you’ll see a corner of the window called the “Console.” By the default the console window is in the bottom left of the RStudio screen.\nYou can type commands in this window where there is a prompt (which will look like a &gt; sign at the bottom of the window). The Console has to be the selected window. (Clicking anywhere in the Console selects it.)\nThe &gt; prompt is R’s way of inviting you to give it instructions. You communicate with R by typing commands after the &gt; prompt.\nType “2+2” at the &gt; prompt, and hit return. You’ll see that R can work like a calculator (among its many other powers). It will give you the answer, 4, and it will label that answer with [1] to indicate that it is the first element in the answer. (This is sort of annoying when the answers are simple like this, but can be very valuable when the answers become more complex.)\nRemember, you don’t type the &gt; sign. The &gt; is the prompt that R gives saying it is ready for input. We reproduce it here so you can see which is input (in blue) and which is output (in black or red).\n\n2 + 2\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nYou can use a wide variety of math functions to make calculations here, e.g., log() calculates the log of a number:\n\nlog(42)\n\n[1] 3.73767\n\n\n(By default, this gives the natural log with base \\(e\\).)\nParentheses are used both as a way to group elements of the calculation and also as a way to denote the arguments of functions. (The “arguments” of a function are the set of values given to it as input.) For example, log(3) is applying the function log() to the argument 3.\nAnother mathematical function that often comes in handy is the square root function, sqrt(). For example, the square root of 4 is:\n\nsqrt(42)\n\n[1] 6.480741\n\n\nTo calculate a value with an exponent, used the ^ symbol. For example \\(4^3\\) is written as:\n\n4 ^ 3\n\n[1] 64\n\n\nNote how R ignores white space when it’s not in quotes (we’ll come back to quotes later):\n\n4^3\n\n[1] 64\n\n4  ^  3\n\n[1] 64\n\n\nOf course, many math functions can be combined to give an almost infinite possibility of mathematical expressions. For example,\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi (3.1)^2}} e ^ {-\\frac{(12 - 10.7) ^ 2}{2 \\times 3.1}}\\]\ncan be calculated with\n\n(1 / (sqrt(2 * pi * (3.1) ^ 2))) * exp(-(12 - 10.7) ^ 2 / (2 * 3.1))\n\n[1] 0.09798692\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Saving your code\nWhen you analyze your own data, we strongly recommend that you keep a record of all commands used, along with copious notes, so that weeks or years later you can retrace the steps of your earlier analysis.\nIn RStudio Cloud, you can create a plain text file (sometimes called a script), which contains R commands that can be reloaded and used at a later date. We have created a scratch file where you can enter and save your commands while you’re learning the tools. Click on “scratch.R” in the lower-right:\n\nThat will open a mostly blank text file above the Console that looks like this:\n\nYou can copy and paste any commands that you want from the Console, or type directly here. (When you copy and paste, it’s better to not include the &gt; prompt in the script.) If you want to keep this script for later, just hit “Save” under the “File” menu. In the future you can open this file in all the normal ways to have those commands available for use again.\nIt is best to type all your commands in the script window and run them from there, rather than typing directly into the console. This lets you save a record of your session so that you can more easily re-create what you have done later.\nFYI, if you want to create a new, blank R script, here’s how. Under the menu at the top, choose “File”, then “New File”, and then “R Script”. This will create a new section in RStudio Cloud with the temporary name “Untitled1” (or similar).\n\n\n1.3.3 Comments\nIn scripts, it can be very useful to save a bit of text which is not to be evaluated by R. You can leave a note to yourself (or a colleague) about what the next line is supposed to do, what its strengths and limitations are, or anything else you want to remember later. To leave a note, we use “comments”, which are a line of text that starts with the hash symbol #. Anything on a line after a # will be ignored by R.\n\n# This is a comment. Running this in R will \n# have no effect.\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Functions\nMost of the work in R is done by functions. A function has a name and one or more arguments. For example, log(4) is a function that calculates the log in base \\(e\\) for the value 4 given as input.\nSometimes functions have optional input arguments. For the function log(), for example, we can specify the optional input argument base to tell the function what base to use for the logarithm. If we don’t specify the base variable, it has a default value of base = e. To get a log in base 10, for example, we would use:\n\nlog(4, base = 10)\n\n[1] 0.60206\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5 Defining variables\nIn R, we can store information of various sorts by assigning them to variables. For example, if we want to create a variable called x and give it a value of 4, we would write\n\nx &lt;- 4\n\nThe middle bit of this – a less than sign and a hyphen typed together to make something that looks a little like a left-facing arrow – tells R to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left. After running the command above, whenever we use x in a command it would be replaced by its value 4. For example, if we add 3 to x, we would expect to get 7.\n\nx + 3\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nVariables in R can store more than just simple numbers. They can store lists of numbers, functions, graphics, etc., depending on what values get assigned to the variable.\nWe can always reassign a new value to a variable. If we now tell R that x is equal to 32\n\nx &lt;- 32\n\nthen x takes its new value:\n\nx\n\n[1] 32\n\n\n\n\n1.3.6 Names\nNaming variables and functions in R is pretty flexible.\nA name has to start with a letter, but that can be followed by letters or numbers. There can’t be any spaces, though.\nNames in R are case-sensitive, which means that Weights and weights are completely different things to R. This is a common and incredibly frustrating source of errors in R.\nIt’s a good idea to have your names be as descriptive as possible, so that you will know what you meant later on when looking at it. (However, if they get too long, it becomes painful and error prone to type them each time we use them, so this, as with all things, requires moderation.)\nSometimes clear naming means that it is best to have multiple words in the name, but we can’t have spaces. Therefore a common approach is like we saw in the previous section, to chain the words with underscores (not hyphens!), as in weights_before_hospital. (Another solution to make separate words stand out in a variable name is to vary the case: weightsBeforeHospital. This is called “Camel Case” because the capital letters are like camel humps.)\n\n\n1.3.7 Vectors\nOne useful feature of R is the ability to sometimes apply functions to an entire collection of numbers. The technical term for a set of numbers is “vector”. For example, the following code will create a vector of five numbers:\n\n c(78, 85, 64, 54, 102, 98.6)\n\n[1]  78.0  85.0  64.0  54.0 102.0  98.6\n\n\nc() is a function that creates a vector, containing the items given in its arguments. To help you remember, you could think of the function c() meaning to “combine” some elements into a vector.\nLet’s add a little extra here to make the computer remember this vector. Let’s assign it to a variable, called temperatureF (because these numbers are actually a set of temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit):\n\ntemperatureF &lt;- c(78, 85, 64, 54, 102, 98.6)\n\nThe combination of the less than sign and the hyphen makes an arrow pointing from right to left—this tells R to assign the stuff on the right to the name on the left. In this case we are assigning a vector to the variable temperatureF.\nInputting this to R causes no obvious output, but R will now remember this vector of temperatures under the name temperatureF. We can view the contents of the vector temperatureF by simply typing its name:\n\ntemperatureF\n\n[1]  78.0  85.0  64.0  54.0 102.0  98.6\n\n\nThe power of vectors is that sometimes R can do the same calculation on all elements of a vector with one command. For example, to convert a temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius, we would want to subtract 32 and multiply times 5/9. We can do that for all the numbers in this vector at once:\n\ntemperatureC &lt;- (temperatureF - 32) * 5 / 9\ntemperatureC\n\n[1] 25.55556 29.44444 17.77778 12.22222 38.88889 37.00000\n\n\nTo pull out one of the numbers in this vector, we add square brackets after the vector name, and inside those brackets put the index of the element we want. (The “index” is just a number giving the relative location in the vector of the item we want. The first item has index 1, etc.) For example, the second element of the vector temperatureC is\n\ntemperatureC[2]\n\n[1] 29.44444\n\n\nOne of the ways to slip up in R is to confuse the [square brackets] which pull out an element of a vector, with the (parentheses) , which is used to enclose the arguments of a function.\nVectors can also operate mathematically with other vectors. For example, imagine you have a vector of the body weights of patients before entering hospital (weight_before_hospital) and another vector with the same patient’s weights after leaving hospital (weight_after_hospital). You can calculate the change in weight for all these patients in one command, using vector subtraction:\n\nweight_before_hospital &lt;- c(100, 102)\nweight_after_hospital &lt;- c(98, 99)\n\nweight_change_during_hospital &lt;- weight_before_hospital - weight_after_hospital\n\nThe result will be a vector that has each patient’s change in weight.\n\n\n1.3.8 Basic calculation examples\nIn this course, we’ll learn how to use a few dozen functions, but let’s start with a couple of basic ones.\nThe function mean() does just what it sounds like: it calculates the sample mean (that is, the average) of the vector given to it as input. For example, the mean of the vector of the temperatures in degrees Celsius from above is 26.81481:\n\nmean(temperatureC)\n\n[1] 26.81481\n\n\nAnother simple (and simply named) function calculates the sum of all numbers in a vector: sum().\n\nsum(temperatureC)\n\n[1] 160.8889\n\n\nTo count the number of elements in a vector, use length().\n\nlength(temperatureC)\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nThis shows that there are 6 temperature values in the vector that make up the vector temperatureC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.9 Reading a file\nIn this course, we have saved the data in a “comma-separated variable” format. All files in this format ought to have “.csv” as the end of their file name. A CSV file is a plain text file, easily read by a wide variety of programs. Each row in the file (besides the first row) is the data for a given individual, and for each individual each variable is listed in the same order, separated by commas. It’s important to note that you can’t have commas anywhere else in the file, besides the separators.\nThe first row of a CSV file should be a “header” row, which gives the names of each variable, again separated by commas.\nFor examples in this tutorial, let’s use a data set about the passengers of the RMS Titanic. One of the data sets in the folder of data attached to this lab is called “titanic.csv”. This is a data set of 1313 passengers from the voyage of this ship, which contains information about some personal info about each passenger as well as whether they survived the accident or not.\nTo import a CSV file into R, use the read_csv() function as in the following command. (This assumes that you have set the working directory to the labs folder, as we described above.)\n\ntitanic_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/titanic.csv\")\n\nThis looks for the file called titanic.csv in the folder called Data. Here we have given the name titanic_data to the object in R that contains all this passenger data. Of course, if you wanted to load a different data set, you would be better off giving it a more apt name than “titanic_data”.\nTo see if the data loads appropriately, you might want to run the command\n\nsummary(titanic_data)\n\n passenger_class        name                age            embarked        \n Length:1313        Length:1313        Min.   : 0.1667   Length:1313       \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:21.0000   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :30.0000   Mode  :character  \n                                       Mean   :31.1942                     \n                                       3rd Qu.:41.0000                     \n                                       Max.   :71.0000                     \n                                       NA's   :680                         \n home_destination       sex              survive         \n Length:1313        Length:1313        Length:1313       \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n\n\nwhich will list all the variables and some summary statistics for each variable.\n\n\n1.3.10 Intro to data frames\nA data frame is a way that R can store a data set on a number of individuals. A data frame is a collection of columns; each column contains the values of a single variable for all individuals. The values of each individual occur in the same order in all the columns, so the first value for one variable represents the same individual as the first value in the lists of all other variables.\nThe function read_csv() loads the data it reads into a data frame.\nThe data frame is usually given a name, which is used to tell R’s functions which data set to use. For example, in the previous section we read in a data set to a data frame that we called titanic_data. This data frame now contains information about each of the passengers on the Titanic. This data frame has seven variables, so it has seven columns (passenger_class, name, age, embarked, home_destination, sex, and survive).\nVery importantly, we can grab one of the columns from a data frame by itself. We write the name of the data frame, followed by a $, and then the name of the variable.\nFor example, to show a list of the age of all the passengers on the Titanic, use\n\ntitanic_data$age\n\n\n\n[1] 29.0000  2.0000 30.0000 25.0000  0.9167 47.0000\n\n\nThis will show a vector that has all the values for this variable age, one for each individual in the data set.\n\n\n1.3.11 Adding a new column\nSometimes we would like to add a new column to a data frame. The easiest way to do this is to simply assign a new vector to a new column name, using the $.\nFor example, to add the log of age as a column in the titanic_data data frame, we can write\n\ntitanic_data$log_age &lt;- log(titanic_data$age)\n\nYou can run the command head(titanic_data) to see that log_age is now a column in titanic_data.\n\n\n1.3.12 Choosing subsets of data\nSometimes we want to do an analysis only on some of the data that fit certain criteria. For example, we might want to analyze the data from the Titanic using only the information from females.\nThe easiest way to do this is to use the filter() function from the package dplyr. Reminder: make sure you have loaded dplyr it into R using library():\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nIn the titanic data set there is a variable named sex, and an individual is female if that variable has value “female”. We can create a new data frame that includes only the data from females with the following command:\n\nfilter(titanic_data, sex == \"female\")\n\n    passenger_class

“female”.\nNote that the syntax here requires a double == sign. In R (and many other computer languages), the double equal sign creates a statement that can be evaluated as TRUE or FALSE, while a single equal sign may change the value of the first variable to the value on the right-hand side of the equal sign. Here we are asking, for each individual, whether sex is “female”, not assigning the value “female” to the variable sex. So we use a double equal sign ==."

    "text": "1.4 Questions for Lab Report\nYour lab report is due before the start of next week’s lab. When you’re finished, save it, and your TA can access it on the Cloud.\n\nFor each week, use the R script called “report.R” to save the commands that you use to answer the questions. Use a # at the beginning of each comment line to record written answers.\n\n\nOpen the report.R file. Start by editing comments with your name at the top.\n\n\n\nSave the script regularly as you work! To save, go to “File &gt; Save” or use command-S shortcut.\n\n\n\nFor each of the questions below, write the question number as a comment, followed by any R code you use to do the question, and give the answers as comments. It might look something like this\n\n\n# Chris Muir\n# BIOL 220 Lab 01\n# 2021-01-12\n\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\n\n# Questions\n\n# 1.

(In addition to being disgusting, the nitrogenous chemicals in urine combine with the pool’s chlorine to produce some toxic chemicals like trichloramine, the source of most skin irritations for swimmers.) A group of researchers (Jmaiff Blackstock et al. 2017) recently realized that an artificial sweetener called ACE passes out in urine unmetabolized and in known average quantities, and therefore by measuring ACE concentrations we can measure the amount of urine in a pool.\n\nHere is a list of measurements, each from a different pool, of the concentration of ACE (measured in ng/L) for 23 different pools in Canada.\n\n640, 1070, 780, 70, 160, 130, 60, 50, 2110, 70, 350, 30, 210, 90, 470, 580, 250, 310, 460, 430, 140, 1070, 130\n\n\nIn R, create a vector of these data, and name it appropriately.\nWhat is the mean ACE concentration of these 23 pools?\nUrine on average has 4000 ng ACE/ ml. Therefore to convert these measurements of ng ACE / L pool water to ml urine / L pool water we need to divide each by 4000. Make a new vector showing the concentration of urine per liter in these 23 pools. Give it a suitable name.\nWhat is the mean concentration of urine per liter? How did this change relative to the mean measurement of ng ACE / L?\nThe arithmetic mean is calculated by adding up all the numbers and dividing by how many numbers there are. Calculate the mean of these numbers using sum() and length(). Did you get the same answer as with using mean()?\nUse R to calculate the average amount of urine (in ml) in a 500,000 L pool.\n\n\nWeddell seals live in Antarctic waters and take long strenuous dives in order to find fish to feed upon. Researchers (Williams et al. 2004) wanted to know whether these feeding dives were more energetically expensive than regular dives (perhaps because they are deeper, or the seal has to swim further or faster). They measured the metabolic costs of dives using the oxygen consumption of 10 animals (in ml O\\(_2\\) / kg) during a feeding dive. Here are the data:\n\n\n71.0, 77.3, 82.6, 96.1, 106.6, 112.8, 121.2, 126.4, 127.5, 143.1\n\nFor the same 10 animals, they also measured the oxygen consumption in non-feeding dives. With the 10 animals in the same order as before, here are those data:\n\n42.2, 51.7, 59.8, 66.5, 81.9, 82.0, 81.3, 81.3, 96.0, 104.1\n\n\nMake a vector for each of these lists, and give them appropriate names.\nConfirm (using R) that both of your vectors have the same number of individuals in them.\nCreate a vector called metabolism_difference by calculating the difference in oxygen consumption between feeding dives and nonfeeding dives for each animal.\nWhat is the average difference between feeding dives and nonfeeding dives in oxygen consumption?\nAnother appropriate way to represent the relationship between these two numbers would be to take the ratio of O\\(_2\\) consumption for feeding dives over the O\\(_2\\) consumption of nonfeeding dives. Make a vector which gives this ratio for each seal.\nSometimes ratios are easier to analyze when we look at the log of the ratio. Create a vector which gives the log of the ratios from the previous step. (Use the natural log.) What is the mean of this log-ratio?\n\n\nThe data file called “countries.csv” in the data folder contains information about all the countries on Earth1. Each row is a country, and each column contains a variable.\n\n\nUse read_csv() to read the data from this file into a data frame called countries.\nUse summary() to get a quick description of this data set. What are the first three variables?\nUsing the output of summary(), how many countries are from Africa in this data set?\nWhat kinds of variables (i.e., categorical or numerical) are continents, cell_phone_subscriptions_per_100_people_2012, total_population_in_thousands_2015, and fines_for_tobacco_advertising_2014? (Don’t go by their variable names – look at the data in the summary results to decide.)\nAdd a new column to your countries data frame that has the difference in ecological footprint between 2012 and 2000. What is the mean of this difference? (Note: this variable will have “missing data”, which means that some of the countries do not have data in this file for one or the other of the years of ecological footprint. By default, R doesn’t calculate a mean unless all the data are present. To tell R to ignore the missing data, add an option to the mean() command that says na.rm=TRUE. We’ll learn more about this later.)\n\n\nUsing the countries data again, create a new data frame called africa_data, that only includes data for countries in Africa. What is the sum of the total_population_in_thousands_2015 for this new data frame?"

    "section": "2.2 Learning the Tools",
    "text": "2.2 Learning the Tools\n\n2.2.1 ggplot\nThe function ggplot() allows us to graph most kinds of data relatively simply. Its syntax is slightly odd but very flexible. We’ll show specific commands for several types of plots below.\nTo begin, you’ll need to install the ggplot2 package, following instructions from last week. Once that’s done, load ggplot2 with:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readr)\n\nTo make a graph with ggplot(), you need to specify at least two elements in your command. The first uses the function ggplot() itself, to specify which data frame you want to use and also which variables are to be plotted. The second part tells R what kind of graph to make, using a geom function. The odd part is that these two parts are put together with a + sign. It’s simplest to see this with an example. We’ll draw a histogram with ggplot() in the next section.\n\n\n2.2.2 Histograms\nUseful when:\n\nResponse (\\(y\\)) variable: Numerical\n\nA histogram represents the frequency distribution of a numerical variable in a sample.\nLet’s see how to make a basic histogram using the age data from the Titanic data set. Make sure you have loaded the data (using read_csv()) into a data frame called titanic_data (hint: if you get an error, remember that you need to load the readr package using the library() function before read_csv() will work).\n\ntitanic_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/titanic.csv\")\n\nHere’s the code to make a simple histogram of age:\n\nggplot(titanic_data, aes(x = age)) + \n  geom_histogram()\n\nNotice that there are two functions called here, put together in a single command with a + sign. You don’t have to put a line break after the + (R ignores it), but it makes the code more readable. The first function is ggplot(), and it has two input arguments. Listed first is titanic_data; this is the name of the data frame containing the variables that we want to graph. The second input to ggplot is an aes() function. In this case, the aes() function tells R that we want Age to be the \\(x\\)-variable (i.e. the variable that is displayed along the \\(x\\)-axis). The “aes” stands for “aesthetics”.\nThe second function in this command is geom_histogram(). This is the part that tells R that the “geometry” of our plot should be a histogram.\nRunning this should give a plot that look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not the most beautiful graph in the world, but it conveys the information. At the end of this tutorial we’ll see a couple of options that can make a ggplot graph look a little better.\n\n\n2.2.3 Bar graphs\nUseful when:\n\nResponse (\\(y\\)) variable: Categorical\n\nA bar graph plots the frequency distribution of a categorical variable.\nIn ggplot(), the syntax for a bar graph is very similar to that for a histogram. For example, here is a bar graph for the categorical variable sex in the titanic data set:\n\nggplot(titanic_data, aes(x = sex)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"count\")\n\nAside from specifying a different variable for \\(x\\), we use a different geom function here, geom_bar. The result should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Boxplots\nUseful when:\n\nExplanatory (\\(x\\)) variable: Categorical\nResponse (\\(y\\)) variable: Numerical, continuous\n\nA boxplot is a convenient way of showing the frequency distribution of a numerical variable in multiple groups. Here’s the code to draw a boxplot for age in the titanic data set, separately for each sex:\n\nggplot(titanic_data, aes(x = sex, y = age)) + \n  geom_boxplot()\n\nNotice that the \\(y\\) variable here is age, and \\(x\\) is the categorical variable sex that winds up on the \\(x\\)-axis. See the result below, and look at where the variables are. The other new feature here is the new geom function, geom_boxplot().\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the thick bar in the middle of each boxplot is the median of that group. The upper and lower bounds of the box extend from the first to the third quartile. The vertical lines are called whiskers, and they cover most of the range of the data (except when data points are pretty far from the median (see text), when they are plotted as individual dots, as on the male boxplot).\n\n\n2.2.5 Scatterplots\nUseful when:\n\nExplanatory (\\(x\\)) variable: Numerical\nResponse (\\(y\\)) variable: Numerical\n\nThe last graphical style that we will cover here is the scatter plot, which shows the relationship between two numerical variables.\nThe titanic data set does not have two numerical variables, so let’s use a different data set—the example 2.3B from p. 43 of Whitlock and Schluter, showing the relationship between the ornamentation of father guppies and the sexual attractiveness of their sons. You can load the data for that example with:\n\nguppy_father_son_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/chap02e3bGuppyFatherSonAttractiveness.csv\")\n\nTo make a scatter plot of the variables fatherOrnamentation and sonAttractiveness with ggplot, you need to specify the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) variables, and use geom_point():\n\n# Side note:  I've added a line break between arguments in ggplot()\n# This has no effect on the code, but makes it easier to read IMO\nggplot(\n  guppy_father_son_data, \n  aes(x = fatherOrnamentation, y = sonAttractiveness)\n  ) +\ngeom_point()\n\nThe result look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Better looking graphics with options\nThe code we have listed here for graphics barely scratches the surface of what ggplot2, and R as a whole, are capable of. Not only are there far more choices about the kinds of plots available, but there are many, many options for customizing the look and feel of each graph. You can choose the font, the font size, the colors, the style of the axes labels, etc., and you can customize the legends and axes legends nearly as much as you want.\nLet’s dig a little deeper into just a couple of options that you can add to any of the forgoing graphs to make them look a little better. For example, you can change the text of the \\(x\\)-axis label or the \\(y\\)-axis label by using xlab() or ylab(). Let’s do that for the scatterplot, to make the labels a little nicer to read for humans.\n\nggplot(\n  guppy_father_son_data, \n  aes(x = fatherOrnamentation, y = sonAttractiveness)\n  ) +\n  geom_point() +\n  xlab(\"Father's ornamentation\") +\n  ylab(\"Son's attractiveness\")\n\nThe labels that we want to add are included in quotes inside the xlab() and ylab() functions. Here is what appears:\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can also be nice to remove the default gray background, to make what some feel is a cleaner graph. Try adding\n\n+ theme_minimal()\n\nto the end of one of your lines of code making a graph, to see whether you prefer the result to the default design.\n\n\n2.2.7 Color palettes\nIt is important to use a palette that will be clear to color blind individuals and, in some cases, to those who view a printed version in greyscale. There are bewildering array of options, but the viridis palettes accomplish these goals well (read more here. We’ll revisit the histogram example above and view the age distribution on the Titanic by sex (multiple histogram). This is a bit more advanced than what we’ve covered so far, but hang in there. We’ll go step-by-step.\nThe cool thing about ggplot2 is we can assign a large number of graphical features (size, color, fill, shape, line type, etc.) to variables on our data. We’ll do that using the fill = ... argument in the aes() function to make the fill of the bars dependent on sex.\n\nggplot(titanic_data, aes(x = age, fill = sex)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 680 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nThat works, but it’s pretty ugly. For one thing, the bars are stacked on top of one another, so it’s hard to see the separate histograms for males and females. We’ll fix that by using the position = ... argument in the geom_histogram() function like this:\n\nggplot(titanic_data, aes(x = age, fill = sex)) +\n  # I will interleaves comments to explain what's going on\n  # position = position_identity() stops the bars from stacking\n  geom_histogram(position = position_identity())\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 680 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, that’s worse! Now the male bars are blocking the female bars. Let’s add a couple more arguments, making the color 50% transparent using the alpha = ... argument. I’ll also make the color around the bars black so we can see them better.\n\nggplot(titanic_data, aes(x = age, fill = sex)) +\n  # alpha = 0.5 makes bars transparent\n  # color = \"black\" adds black lines around bars\n  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, color = \"black\", position = position_identity())\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 680 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter, but not great. Let’s use the facet_grid() function to put the histograms on separate panels. For this, we have to put sex in quotes (learning when things need to be quoted or not is frustrating).\n\nggplot(titanic_data, aes(x = age, fill = sex)) +\n  # facet_grid() makes separate panels for each sex\n  facet_grid(rows = \"sex\") +\n  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, color = \"black\", position = position_identity())\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 680 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty good. Now, let’s finally add the viridis palette. ggplot2 has some built in functions that you can just add using the + operator to change the color, like this:\n\nggplot(titanic_data, aes(x = age, fill = sex)) +\n  facet_grid(rows = \"sex\") +\n  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, color = \"black\", position = position_identity()) +\n  # This function changes the color palette\n  scale_fill_viridis_d()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 680 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.8 Getting help\nThe help pages in R are the main source of help, but the amount of detail might be off-putting for beginners. For example, to explore the options for ggplot(), enter the following into the R Console.\n\nhelp(ggplot)\n\nThis will cause the contents of the manual page for this function to appear in the Help window in RStudio Cloud. These manual pages are often frustratingly technical. What many of us do instead is simply google the name of the function—there are a great number of resources online about R."

    "text": "2.3 Questions\n\n2.3.0.1 1. Revisiting the Countries data\nLet’s use the data from “countries.csv” to practice making some graphs.\n\nRead the data from the file “countries.csv” in the “data” folder. (Hint: we did this in the last lab - you need to use read_csv(), use the correct path, and give the object a name.)\nMake sure that you have run library(ggplot2). Why is this necessary for the remainder of this question?\nMake a histogram to show the frequency distribution of values for measles_immunization_oneyearolds, a numerical variable. (This variable gives the percentage of 1-year-olds that have been vaccinated against measles.) Describe the pattern that you see.\nMake a bar graph to show the numbers of countries in each of the continents. (The categorical variable continent indicates the continent to which countries belong.)\nDraw a scatterplot that shows the relationship between the two numerical variables life_expectancy_at_birth_male and life_expectancy_at_birth_female.\n\n\n\n2.3.0.2 2. Ecological footprint\nThe ecological footprint is a widely-used measure of the impact a person has on the planet. It measures the area of land (in hectares) required to generate the food, shelter, and other resources used by a typical person and required to dispose of that person’s wastes. Larger values of the ecological footprint indicate that the typical person from that country uses more resources.\nThe countries data set has two variables for many countries showing the ecological footprint of an average person in each country. ecological_footprint_2000 and ecological_footprint_2012 show the ecological footprints for the years 2000 and 2012, respectively.\n\nPlot the relationship between the ecological footprint of 2000 and of 2012.\nDescribe the relationship between the footprints for the two years. Does the value of ecological footprint of 2000 seem to predict anything about its value in 2012?\nFrom this graph, does the ecological footprint tend to go up or down in the years between 2000 and 2012? Did the countries with high or low ecological footprint change the most over this time? (Hint: you can add a one-to-one line to your graph by adding + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1) to your ggplot() command. This will make it easier to see when your points are above or below the line of equivalence.)\n\n\n\n2.3.0.3 3. Plotting categorical and numerical variables\nUse the countries data again. Plot the relationship between continent and female life expectancy at birth. Describe the patterns that you see.\n\n\n2.3.0.4 4. Bat tongues\nMuchala (2006) measured the length of the tongues of eleven different species of South American bats, as well as the length of their palates (to get an indication of the size of their mouths). All of these bats use their tongues to feed on nectar from flowers. Data from the article are given in the file “BatTongues.csv”. In this file, both Tongue Length and Palette Length are given in millimeters.\n\nImport the data and inspect it using summary(). You can call the data set whatever you like, but in one of the later steps we’ll assume it is called bat_tongues. Each value for tongue length and palate length is a species mean, calculated from a sample of individuals per species.\nDraw a scatter plot to show the association between palate length and tongue length, with tongue length as the response variable. Describe the association: is it positive or negative? Is it strong or weak?\nAll of the data points that went into this graph have been double checked and verified. With that in mind, what conclusion can you draw from the outlier on the scatterplot?\nLet’s figure out which species is the outlier. To do this, we’ll use a useful function called filter() from the dplyr package. Use library() to load dplyr to your R session.\nThe function filter() gives us the row (or rows) of a data frame that has a certain property. Looking at the graph, we can tell that the point we are interested in has a very long tongue_length, at least over 80 mm long! The following command will pull out the rows of the data frame bat_tongues that tongue_length greater than 80 mm:\n\n\nfilter(bat_tongues, tongue_length &gt; 80)\n\nThe unusual species is Anoura fistulata (See a photo here). This species has an outrageously long tongue, which it uses to collect nectar from a particular flower (can you guess what feature of the flower has led to the evolution of such a long tongue?). See the article by Muchala (2006) to learn more about the biology of this strange bat.\n\n\n2.3.0.5 5. Improve your figure!\nPick one of the plots you made using R today. What could be improved about this graph to make it a more effective presentation of the data?"
