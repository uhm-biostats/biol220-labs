# Day 1 wrap-up

## Reflection exercise

1. One up/one down.
1. Or everyone share 1 discovery or question from the day. 

## Key points from today 

1. Process models are games, with rules and nondeterministic (but consistent) outcomes.
1. The UNTB is a foundational process model for ecology.

## Looking toward tomorrow

1. Tomorrow, we'll generalize from UNTB to do more involved, _multidimensional_ process modeling.
1. Get some rest!
