# Introduction

## Notes for asychronous use

These are the materials for the second 2 days of the "Multidimensional Biodiversity Data" workshop first offered in Albequerque, NM in June 2023 by the RoLE Model team. For the first two days' materials, see [the course website here.](https://role-model.github.io/multidim-biodiv-data) 

To work through these materials asynchronously, you will need some software packages installed on your computer. We have provided a Docker image with the necessary packages already set up. To get going with this, see the [setup instructions](software_setup.qmd).

The first days' materials (from "Theory/conceptual motivation for process models" through to "Intro to machine learning inference with neutral simulations") are also available as video lectures on YouTube:

1. [Theory and motivation of process modeling](https://youtu.be/s6RwgGlIop8)
2. [The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity as a process model](https://youtu.be/fuijMa_hTwo)
3. [Inferring the parameters of neutral theory from model outcomes](https://youtu.be/F8T007EdiHQ)
