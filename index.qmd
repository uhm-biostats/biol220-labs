# Setup {.unnumbered}

## Software and Cloud Services

All labs will use *R*, *RStudio*, and *Posit Cloud*.

*R* is a computer program that allows an extraordinary range of statistical calculations. It is a free program, mainly written by volunteer contributors from around the world.

*RStudio* is a separate program, also free, that allows you to easily organize separate tabs for *R* code files, graphic, help docs, and more.

For this course, you won't need *R* and *RStudio* installed on your own device because we will work in *Posit Cloud*. However, if you wish to install them on your device, go to <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/> for instructions about getting set up.

## Using *Posit Cloud*

We have setup Workspaces for each lab section.  For example, the workspace for section 001 is biol220-sec001. Join the *Posit Cloud* Workspace for your lab section by clicking on the appropriate link in the Lab 01 Assignment on Laulima.

**Important**: Login with your userid@hawaii.edu account, not a personal gmail account. If you accidentally use your personal account, let your TA know. They will delete it while you register with the university account.

**Note**: Wherever images say "lab02", replace that with the actual lab number you will be completing (e.g. "lab01" or "lab11").

Once you're logged in, the lab01 Workspace will looking something like this (*note: where it says "-monday" in the picture should be your section number*):

Each item listed under "All Projects" is a "Project" within the biol220-sec001 Workspace. You will copy this and work from your own copy (you cannot edit the original). 

To create your own, click "START" to the left of "lab01".

**Disclaimer: These labs rely heavily on those developed by Mike Whitlock for his BIOL 300 course at UBC <https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~whitlock/bio300/>.** In some cases the materials have been used *verbatim*, in other cases Chris Muir, and/or Andy Rominger have added new material, or heavily modified the original material by Prof. Whitlock.
